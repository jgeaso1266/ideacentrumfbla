Idea Centrum Instructions

When you open the app the first time, you will see a login screen.
If you have login credentials (email and password), enter them 
here. If not, click the register button and fill in all fields.

The home page is a grid view of centroids, a title, an idea, and
sometimes, a picture. Click one of those centroids to see more
information, such as the problem the idea aims to solve, the 
things the ideamaker needs in order to continue with their idea,
as well as the link to the profile of the ideamaker so that you
can contact them. There is also a share button for you to share 
the idea on social media.

Along the bottom of the screen is the navigation bar with three
items: add, home, and profile. They are pretty self-explanatory.

The home button takes you back to the home page.

To add a centroid, press the add button and fill in the 
required information. 

To view your profile, press the profile button. There you will 
be able to change your information and add information on your
background, education, and experience. You will also find prior
centroids that you made. There is also a button at the top to 
report a bug in the app.
